# Minecraft Network Protocol Docs 11/7/25
For r21_u13, Network Protocol Version 893

## Dev Notes
We have begun moving to cereal, and as part of the update there might be breaking changes that are unknown us. There are updates to Required and Optional fields, which will be enforced by cereal and some emums that might have accidently changed to a string repsentation. Some of these will be fixed in our next official release.

- Animate Packet
  - Action and Swing Source enums showing up as strings.
- AvailableCommandsPacket
- ClientboundControlSchemeSetPacket
